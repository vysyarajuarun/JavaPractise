/*
	CLASS :
			1. Class is a custom datatype
			2. We can also say class is a template of the object
			3. Simply class is plan of object.
			4. We can relate classes and objects with real time entities.
			5. We can also depict real time scenarios using classes and objects.
			6. Objects in programming language is similar to real time objects.
			
		//Class is Template or an blueprint, objects are instances of class
		
	OBJECT: 
			Objects are instance of class.
			1. Objects has properties and functionalities.
			2. Similarly object has state and behaviour.
	
	Real time simple example
		Let's take car --> it cab be class and it's 
		properties are :
					1. Engine
					2. Doors.
					3. Transmission system.
					4. Seats
					
		Functionalities:
					1. Breakes
					2. Running of car is functionality.
					3. Stopping of car \\
					
		Using these properties we can do some funcionalities , likewise ex : Steering wheel is a property but we can control the car.
		
		Using above example in the simiilar way we can use class and objects to buils some functionality.
